          I'm an ambitious, outgoing and enthusiastic developer with a
          background in design, having worked as an art director and freelance
          illustrator and designer, where I found a passion in software
          engineering. I love to learn, and have taught myself full-stack
          development through the codecademy full-stack engineer career path and
          a series of personal projects creating full-stack apps. You can see
          some project highlights below, and fill out the email form if you'd
          like to get in touch.
